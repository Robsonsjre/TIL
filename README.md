# TIL

### 25/03/2020
- TIL **(Blockchain)** *RSK* -> How to use configure metamask to work at RSK testnet. Blockexplorer and remix for deploying smart contracts over there. 

### 26/03/2020
- TIL **(Defi)** *Uniswap* -> I learned how Uniswap V2 improved on chain oracle manipulation:
-> Storing the "last block asset price" -> Manipulators need to manipulate two blocks in a row now.
-> Using TWAP (Time Weightned Avg Price) -> You can set the time window you willl use to your application. Higher the time window, higher is the cost of manipulation.
