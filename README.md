### 25/03/2020
- TIL **(Blockchain)** *RSK* -> How to use configure metamask to work at RSK testnet. Blockexplorer/faucet and remix for deploying smart contracts over there. 

### 26/03/2020
- TIL **(Defi)** *Uniswap* -> I learned how [Uniswap V2 improved on chain oracle manipulation](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2/#testnet-and-launch-details):
-> Storing the "last block asset price" -> Manipulators need to manipulate two blocks in a row now.
-> Using TWAP (Time Weightned Avg Price) -> You can set the time window you willl use to your application. Higher the time window, higher is the cost of manipulation.

[Pt2 - Uniswap History](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-history/)

### 30/03/2020

- TIL **(Ethereum)** *Solidity* -> Had a Meetup with Jeff Prestes explaning the changes for solidity 0.6 version. Basically now you have fallback and receive functions. Array.pop() method, abstract, and others. ABIENCODERV2 is now safe!

### 31/03/2020

- TIL **(Defi)** *UMA* -> Tested new UMA price oracle approach. The problem they are solving is reducing the amount of times MakerDAO updates their oracle unnecessary. In their approach a person trying to liquidate or withdraw needs to wait a time window of 1 hour, and them we have monetary incentives for "validators" to attempt a band intention liquidation/withdraw.
